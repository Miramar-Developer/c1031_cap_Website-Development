						Captec Systems Ltd was formed in January 2013, with the aim of becoming a leading provider of investor relations and marketing software solutions for the investment management sector.<br>
<br>
The software systems have been designed and developed by fund management professionals; the firm was founded by the former COO and partner of a $5bn multi-strategy Deutsche Bank spin out hedge fund. Here, experience of marketing needs and demands was acquired first-hand. Consequently the Captec products are built to meet a fund manager’s specific requirements.<Br>
<br>
Based in Oxford, Captec benefits from a deep pool of intellectual capital. The City’s university produces some of the world’s finest computer engineers and mathematicians, which allows for top-tier technology products to be built as robust, secure and efficient systems.<br>
<br>
At Captec we believe that software products should be easy to use, yet comprehensive and specific to a client’s exact needs. Furthermore, pricing should be transparent and allow for scale within a business. Indeed, we commit to firm-wide fee structures such that all levels of a business, from C-level partners and directors to junior analysts, can use the systems without being restricted by per user licence fees.<br>
<br>
Captec’s core philosophy is that great quality IR products will help our clients improve their marketing and compliance efforts and consequently increase their AUM.
