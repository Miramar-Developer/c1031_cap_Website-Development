						Captec Portal enables you to allocate different documents and categories to different types of users. This means that the Portal can be used as a broker and service-provider on-boarding tool. Likewise, credit teams can retrieve regular data releases with no extra impact on your workload. Portal can operate as a company ‘Intranet’ where important internal documents and reports such as employment and compliance manuals can be made available for review to employees only.
