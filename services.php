					<div class="twelve columns centered services-text">Captec offers bespoke software development and IT solutions consultancy for the asset management sector.<br><br>
Captec was founded by a former COO of a multi-billion dollar alternative investment manager. Consequently the business has a deep understanding of the industry, which is brought to the development work that Captec carries out so that it is much more than just straightforward ‘IT implementation’. The services represent bespoke solutions that are tailored to a client’s specific issues and needs.<br><br>
Development projects typically comprise an element of designing the solution to the problem itself and then creating the software structures to address the need. Often these requirements involve the automation of an otherwise time-consuming manual process that may be prone to human error.<br><br>
Captec has experience in all areas across the asset management sector including investment and trading, investor relations, operations, finance and compliance.
